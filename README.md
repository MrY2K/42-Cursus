Welcome to my personal journal documenting my adventure through the 42 school curriculum – a place where learning is hands-on, peer-driven, and totally unconventional. Here, I capture my projects, milestones, and the fun (and sometimes wild) challenges I face on my path to becoming a coding wizard.

## 🌟 The 42 Experience

At 42, there are no classes, no teachers – just pure project-based learning and collaboration. Every project is a stepping stone that pushes my boundaries, and every failure is just another lesson learned.

  <summary><strong>🎯 Key Milestones</strong></summary>

  - **Piscine:** The intense bootcamp that kickstarted my journey.
  - **Libft:** Crafting my own C library to master fundamentals.
  - **Get Next Line:** Conquering file I/O and memory management.
  - **Minishell:** Building a fully functional shell with an amazing team.
  - **Push Swap:** Optimizing algorithms with creative problem-solving.
  - **Cub3D:** Diving into graphics and game development.
  - **…and many more epic projects!**

## 🛠️ Projects & Toolkit

I work with a mix of languages, tools, and methodologies that make every project a new adventure:

- **Languages:** C, C++, Bash, Python, and more.
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, custom 42 utilities.
- **Method:** Peer-to-peer learning, self-driven problem solving, and continuous improvement.
